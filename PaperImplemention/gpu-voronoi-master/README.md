# Voronoi Diagrams on the GPU

This is a GPU implementation of the Jump Flooding Algorithm to generate Voronoi diagrams. I wrote a blog post on how it works - you can find it [here](http://rykap.com/graphics/skew/2016/02/25/voronoi-diagrams/). Or you can skip right to the [paper that it's based on](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/jfa.html).
